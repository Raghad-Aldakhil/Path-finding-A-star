### Artificial Intelligence Project
path planning problem using A-star algorithm 

## Project description 
<p>In this project, we are implementing A-star algorithm, to solve a path planning problem. </p>

## Heuristic function
<p> In this project, the L∞ (L-infinity) heuristic function ia used, also known as the Chebyshev distance or maximum heuristic, is a distance metric that calculates the maximum difference between the coordinates of two points in a grid. In the context of pathfinding algorithms, it is used to estimate the minimum number of moves required to reach the goal state from a given state.
In a grid, where diagonal movement is allowed with a cost of 1 or √2, the L∞ heuristic calculates the maximum of the absolute.
This heuristic function provides a more accurate estimate of the actual cost required to reach the goal state when diagonal movements are allowed. </p>
